# Project Name: Bank Account Project

## Project Description
This application simulates a real-world banking system. It incorporates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation—to model customers, accounts, and financial transactions. The project also includes a SQLite database for persistent storage of customer and account data.



## Project Tasks

**Task 1: Implement Inheritance, Composition, and User Interaction**
- Create Classes and add user interaction to the main app
- Configure Git and GitHub repository

**Task 2: Add interface and implement polymorphism**
- Create ITransactables interface
- Implement polymorphism into classes

**Task 3: Adjust code abstraction, constructors, & access specifiers**
- Update the main functionalities of the application
- Change access specifiers to better incorporate encapsulation

**Task 4: Database Implementation**
- Add database functionality using SQLite and create database access objects (DAO's)
- Adjust core classes to better implement database functionality

**Task 5: Document the project**
- Create a comprehensive README file
- Write user and developer documentation

**Task 6: Finalize and submit**
- Review and refine the project
- Submit the final version on GitHub

## Project Skills Learned
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration
- Project planning and task management
- Software development and debugging
- Writing documentation

## Language Used
- **Java**: Chosen for its strong object-oriented structure, clarity, and wide use in enterprise applications. Java provides robust class-based design, making it ideal for modeling real-world banking systems and building scalable applications.
- **SQL (SQLite)**: Used to store and manage customer and account data persistently. SQLite provides a lightweight, file-based relational database that requires no setup, making it ideal for small to medium applications.
